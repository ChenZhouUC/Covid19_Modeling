	abstract = {The Omicron outbreak in Shanghai has been going on for more than a month although the lockdown of the city has been enforced. In this work, we present a simple and easy-to-use model to evaluate and forecast the spreading trend. After data fitting, we concluded that the maximum overall number infected in Shanghai will exceed 300,000 and the turning point will be in the coming days around April 13-15, 2022. Our model would provide us important parameters such as the average quarantine ratio, the detection interval from being infected to being tested positive, and the spreading coefficient. We found that it would take 1 to 2 days before the infected patients could be tested positive, which was responsible for the rapid Omicron spread in Shanghai. Furthermore, the quarantine ratio was greater than 1, indicating that the lockdown policy was effective, making quelling the epidemic possible. More importantly, our model could not only enable us to predict the spreading precisely, but also lay the theoretical foundation for better policy making in the prevention of Omicron spread.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statementby research grants 81970132, 81770142, 81800144, 31800642, 82100153 and 82104582 from National Natural Science Foundation of China, a research grant 20JC1410600 from Shanghai Science and Technology Committee, Shanghai Guangci Translational Medical Research Development Foundation, a research grant 20152504 from Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, Gaofeng Clinical Medicine Grant Support, The Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institute of Higher Learning, Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
